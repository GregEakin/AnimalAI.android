# Animal AI for Android
This is a [self-learning program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning), that identifies animals by asking questions.
Originally developed from:
* [Creative Computing, Morristown, New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Computing_(magazine))
* [BAISC Computer Games, Edited by David H. Ahl, published 1978](https://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/index.php)
* [Animal (by Author Luehrmann, Nathan Teichholtz, Steve North)](https://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/showpage.php?page=4)

The original program used a [Heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)) inside an array, for the question tree.
This version uses a database and an ORM wrapper instead. Giving us data persistence between runs.

### This is work in progress. It's not running yet.
See the [.Net version](https://github.com/GregEakin/AnimalAi.Net), for working version.
